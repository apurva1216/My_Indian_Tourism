    <h3>About Indian Tourism Beauty and Culture</h3>
    <h4>Why to Explore India</h4>
    <P>
        The Indian subcontinent with its southern tip projecting into the Indian Ocean, 
        the northern plate rising up to the Himalayas, and the northwestern side housing
        a major chunk of the Thar Desert, lends itself to a fascinating topography and 
        climate. This southern region and the peninsula of Asia is home to a dizzying array
        of beaches, backwaters, mangrove jungles, isolated islands, and tropical and evergreen 
        wilderness that bristle with a flora and fauna unique to it. A melange of tea and coffee
        estates, mountain passes, trekking trails and splendid rapids enthusing rafting lovers,
        a bucolic countryside, sleepy hill stations, bustling cities with towering skyscrapers, 
        make the subcontinent particularly unique for trying to wrap everything in. Add to it 
        India'so many languages, cultures, cuisine, history and architecture, and you have a land
        filled with gems, any direction you choose to go.

    <h4>Popular Weekend Getaways in India</h4>
    <p>
        India's north thrives under the shadow of the Himalayas and the unique ecosystem it renders to
        the states that fall in its territory. Home to the snow leopard, red fox, the Himalayan ibex 
        aside from a thousand species of birds and butterflies, this landscape can be explored through
        walks, hikes, high-altitude treks and even by rafting down a river. Popular Himalayan getaways
        include Shimla, Manali, Mashobra, Mussoorie, Dalhousie, Dharamshala, McLeodganj, Leh-Ladakh, 
        Pahalgam, Srinagar, Ziro, Gangtok, Darjeeling, Ghum, Mirik, Nainital, Kullu, Kufri, Landore, 
        Lansdowne, Almora, Ranikhet, Kasauli, Kausani, Kasol, Malana. In all this, you experience the
        Himalayan hospitality, a cuisine unique with every region made using local ingredients that 
        grow in the foothills, and a culture that draws from its settlers whether it is the Buddhists 
        monks of McLeodganj or the Israelis around Kasol and other parts of Parvati Valley. From relishing
        a yak cheese sandwich with a hand-beaten coffee to meeting the locals and trekking from one sleepy
        village to the other, Himalayas unfurl a unique side to the subcontinent both in terms of pace and
        scenery.

    <h4>Best time to travel around in India</h4>
    <p>
        Owing to the influence of the Thar Desert to its west and the Himalayas to its north, India experiences 
        an extraordinary range of climates, varying from tropical in the south to temperate in the north and
        alpine in the Himalayan north. A good time to see the beaches and any coastal place like Goa, Kerala, 
        Odisha, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal is the winter months between late-October and February when the beaches 
        are between warm to pleasant, beckoning you to spend long hours in the outdoors. In the summer months
        starting from March to July, the hill stations of the north, or even places like Darjeeling, Arunachal,
        Gangtok are good and provide respite from the heat of the plains. But if snow is on your mind, you shouldn't 
        miss a trip to Pahalgam, Dhanaulti, Chamba, Manali, Shimla, Mashobra in the north in the winter months from
        November to January. The desert destinations are better in the colder months too when you can enjoy a camel 
        safari, walk around the local markets and soak up life on the streets. The best thing about India is there 
        is a destination to suit your preference any time of the year, and so the best time to visit India is all
        year round.
